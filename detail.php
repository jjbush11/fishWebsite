            <p>Lake Malawi is an extraordinary lake home to a wide diversity of life, with over 1,000 species of fish (possibly 2,000) in 
                its waters. That’s more species than the lakes and rivers of Europe combined.
            </p>
            <p>Lake Malwai's diverse waters isn't what makes it special, its the fish in the lake that cannot be found anywhere else on the planet. 
                A fact which makes it one of the most valuable water ecosystems on Earth in terms of natural diversity.
            </p>
            <p>Of Lake Malawi’s many freshwater species, easily the most beloved is its collection of over 600 species of Cichlid. 
                These colourful fish are found all over the world but are abundant in Lake Malawi. This is proof of its credentials as a truly 
                unique underwater ecosystem.

            <h2>Trout and Salmon</h2>

            <p>Trout and salmon live in both salt and freshwater, this means a lot of traveling through rivers.
                Salmon and troat also like to lay their eggs in the same streamns of where they were born. Their sense oof smell is so keen
                that the fish follow the chemical scent-trail of their home streams through the oceans; by using this they find their way back 
                to spawn in the streams they were born in.</p>
            <p>Another fact about Salmon is that they are known as a keystone species in Northwest America, meaning that the ecosystem
                is dependent upon them, and if they go extinct it would have a massive negative impact on their environment.</p>
            <p>Lastly, brown trout can lay up to 900 eggs per pound of body weight</p>
